## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Anti-detection via randomized user agents, headless Chrome, and WebDriver spoofing.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Supports authenticated proxies for IP masking and anonymity.
- **Concurrent Scraping**: Multi-threaded execution for faster data harvesting.
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrates with external APIs (e.g., Hunter.io) for additional intelligence.
- **Dynamic Input**: Prompt-based URL entry for flexibility.
- **Output Formats**: Saves data in both CSV and JSON formats for easy analysis.
- **Hacker Aesthetic**: Colored terminal output for a professional, cyberpunk vibe.
